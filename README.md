## What Are the Key Features of GarmentIQ?

GarmentIQ uses computer vision and models like tinyViT, BiRefNet, and HRNet to classify garments, remove backgrounds, and detect key features with precision. It turns expert know-how into an intuitive measurement systemâ€”no coding required. Fully modular and customizable, it adapts to your workflows while delivering fast, accurate results out of the box.

## Overview of QarmentIQ Python package

The `gqrmentiq` package provides an automated solution for garment measurement from images, utilizing computer vision techniques for classification, segmentation, and landmark extraction.

- `tailor`: This module acts as the central agent for the entire pipeline, orchestrating the different stages of garment measurement from classification to landmark derivation. It integrates the functionalities of other modules to provide a smooth end-to-end process.

- `classification`: This module is responsible for identifying the type of garment in an image. Its key functions include: `fine_tune_pytorch_nn`, `load_data`, `load_model`, `predict`, `test_pytorch_nn`, `train_pytorch_nn`, and `train_test_split`

- `segmentation`: This module focuses on isolating garment features from the background for improved measurement accuracy. Its key functions include: `change_background_color`, `extract`, `load_model`, and `process_and_save_images`.

- `landmark`: This module handles the detection, derivation, and refinement of key points on garments. Its key functions include: `derive`, `detect`, and `refine`.

- Instruction Schemas: The `instruction/` folder contains 9 predefined measurement schemas in `.json` format, which are utilized by the `garment_classes.py` file `garment_classes` dictionary to define different garment types and their predefined measurement properties. Users can also define their own custom measurement instructions by creating new dictionaries formatted similarly to the existing garment classes.
