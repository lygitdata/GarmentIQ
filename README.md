## Overview of QarmentIQ

The GarmentIQ package is designed for automated garment measurement from images, leveraging computer vision models. It provides a modular and customizable framework for classifying, segmenting, and extracting key features from garment images to generate precise measurements.

The package structure is organized into several key modules, each handling a specific aspect of the garment measurement pipeline:

tailor: This is the main class that orchestrates the entire measurement pipeline, integrating functionalities from other modules. It handles classification, segmentation, landmark detection, refinement, and derivation, and manages input/output operations.
utils: Contains various utility functions used across the package, such as unzipping files, checking directory structures, validating metadata, computing measurement distances, and exporting data to JSON.
classification: This module focuses on garment image classification. It includes functionalities for:
Training and fine-tuning PyTorch neural networks (train_pytorch_nn.py, fine_tune_pytorch_nn.py).
Loading data and models (load_data.py, load_model.py).
Making predictions (predict.py).
Defining various CNN and transformer models (model_definition.py).
Splitting data into training and testing sets (train_test_split.py).
segmentation: Handles image segmentation tasks, including:
Loading segmentation models (load_model.py).
Extracting segmentation masks (extract.py).
Changing background colors of images (change_background_color.py).
Processing and saving segmented images (process_and_save_images.py).
landmark: Dedicated to garment landmark detection, derivation, and refinement:
detection: Manages landmark detection, including model loading (load_model.py) and utility functions for image transformation and prediction processing (utils.py).
derivation: Focuses on deriving new keypoint coordinates based on existing landmarks and mask intersections (derive_keypoint_coord.py, process.py).
refinement: Contains functions for refining landmark locations using blurred masks (refine_landmark_with_blur.py).
Utilities for finding and filling landmark coordinates within instruction dictionaries (utils.py).
The garment_classes.py file defines the different garment types supported by the system, along with their respective landmark properties and instructional JSON file paths. The instruction JSON files (e.g., long sleeve dress.json) provide detailed information about predefined and custom landmarks, and the measurements associated with each garment type, including the landmarks used for each measurement.
