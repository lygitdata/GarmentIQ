## Why GarmentIQ Is Smarter Than Your Tape Measure?

### We taught machines how to measure clothes like your grandma (but faster).

We've set up shop in the digital world, powered by computer vision magic and a fancy mix of models like tinyViT, BiRefNet, and HRNet. Our system removes backgrounds, classifies garments, and figures out where the sleeve ends and the waist begins—all with scary-good precision.

### We simplify expert know-how into something machines can understand.

No need for complex coding or tedious formatting. Just select the key points you want to measure - shoulder to cuff, hem width, neckline - and GarmentIQ automatically transforms those inputs into a machine-friendly measurement schema. It's fast, intuitive, and tailored to the way professionals actually work.

### It’s flexible, like your favorite pair of stretchy jeans.

GarmentIQ is built to bend to your needs. Want to swap in your own models or tweak the measurement logic for a specific brand or category? No problem. The system is modular and customizable, so you stay in control while still benefiting from a strong out-of-the-box solution.
