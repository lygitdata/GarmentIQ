GarmentIQ MagicBox is a streamlined, Docker-based JupyterLab environment designed to simplify the use of the GarmentIQ Python API. By packaging the development tools and dependencies into a Docker container, MagicBox ensures a consistent and reproducible environment for all usersâ€”eliminating the need for complex local setup or manual dependency management. Whether you're analyzing garment data, prototyping models, or running production-grade scripts, MagicBox offers a plug-and-play solution that gets you up and running quickly and reliably.

    docker run -d --name magicbox_container -p 8888:8888 -p 5000:5000 -p 5001:5001 -p 5002:5002 --gpus all -v "%cd%\working:/app/working" garmentiq_magicbox
    ```

  - Run with CPU only.

    ```bash
    docker run -d --name magicbox_container -p 8888:8888 -p 5000:5000 -p 5001:5001 -p 5002:5002 -v "%cd%\working:/app/working" garmentiq_magicbox
